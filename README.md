The Index.html file is an incorporation of Timilehin's form page and my Navigation, footer and 'Section" part of the code.
The figma design that was given to us from the figma team (https://www.figma.com/file/Op1bXvAx5auH6PwWKOJvmI/Zuri-Training-Landing-Page-(Team-Eureka)?node-id=0%3A1) 
was my guide in the coding, though i didn't follow it strictly.

I'm still learning to code, so feel free to edit the codes as much as is necessary.
For the Css, it is made up of styling from Timi's work and mine.
I wasn't able to add comments during coding, sorry about that.
I feel confident that with singlemindedness, we can get to the top in this competition.
Please feel free to contact me if you need more information about this project.
